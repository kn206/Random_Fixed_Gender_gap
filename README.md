# Random_Fixed_Gender_wage_gap
Analysis of the Fixed and Random Effect model on the gender wage gap
This repository contains code and data for analyzing the gender wage gap using fixed and random effects models. The study aims to quantify and understand the disparities in wages between genders using different modeling approaches.

The analysis utilizes fixed and random effects models to examine the impact of gender-related variables on wage differences. The code includes data preprocessing, model specification, estimation, and interpretation of results.
